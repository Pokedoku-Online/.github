# Pokedoku

Welcome to **Pokedoku**, the ultimate PokÃ©mon logic puzzle game that combines the challenge of Sudoku with the vast world of PokÃ©mon! If you love puzzles and PokÃ©mon trivia, Pokedoku offers a unique and engaging experience that will test your knowledge and strategic thinking.

## What is Pokedoku?

Pokedoku is a **grid-based puzzle game** where players must correctly place PokÃ©mon based on specific criteria for each row and column. The game follows a simple yet thought-provoking structure:

- The grid (typically **3x3**) consists of empty slots that need to be filled.
- Each row and column is assigned a unique **condition**, such as PokÃ©mon type, region, evolution stage, or abilities.
- Players must **select PokÃ©mon that satisfy both the row and column conditions** without repeating any PokÃ©mon within the grid.

With thousands of possible combinations, every game is a new challenge, requiring a mix of logical deduction and PokÃ©mon expertise.
